Event: UC Berkeley - CSUA Hackathon on 11/21/2014

Welcome to Chess Commentator! It's an artificial intelligence that rates a particular chess move as good or bad, comments on it "e.g. the knight is now threatening the rook, black is in the lead" and attempts to analyze the chess metagame.

This will be an approximately 18-hour-long hack written for the CSUA hackathon for fall of 2014.

To be improved in the future!
